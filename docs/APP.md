# GrabBox — install & run, on everything

GrabBox is the "make it a software" answer to this repo. It downloads anything
a plain HTTP link can serve — video, audio, images, installers, archives,
documents — plus everything yt-dlp already knows (YouTube, 1800+ sites,
playlists). There are four ways to use it:

1. **Desktop app** (Windows / macOS / Linux) — the flagship. One installer,
   everything bundled, no prerequisites. → section 1a
2. **Browser extension** — a faded toolbar icon that lights up over
   downloadable things, right-click "Grab with GrabBox", and an in-page
   download dialog with quality options. → section 2
3. **Android app** (Android 6+) — native app with the engine bundled;
   share any link straight into it. → section 4
4. **The core** (any platform) — the Python server + web UI underneath it
   all. This is what the desktop app and extension actually talk to.
   → section 1b

Everything runs **on your device**. Nothing is uploaded anywhere.

## 1a. Desktop app (recommended on computers)

Download from the **[Releases page](https://github.com/sharthak18/A-WAY-TO-DOWNLOAD-YOUTUBE-AUDIO-/releases/latest)**
— the front-page [README](../README.md#download) has one-click buttons. File names
are stable, so `…/releases/latest/download/<name>` always fetches the newest build:

| OS | File | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | `GrabBox-Windows-Setup.exe` (or `GrabBox-Windows.msi`) | run it |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `GrabBox-macOS-AppleSilicon.dmg` | open, drag GrabBox to Applications |
| macOS (Intel) | `GrabBox-macOS-Intel.dmg` | same |
| Linux | `GrabBox-Linux.AppImage` (no install) or `GrabBox-Linux.deb` | `chmod +x` the AppImage, or `sudo apt install ./GrabBox-Linux.deb` |

(Unreleased builds of every push are also under **Actions → desktop (Tauri) →
Artifacts**, but those need a GitHub login and expire after 90 days.)

yt-dlp, ffmpeg and a JS runtime are bundled **inside** the app — install and
open, nothing else to get. It sits in the system tray, single instance:
pasting a link while it's already running just focuses the window.

The flow: paste URL (or it arrives from the extension / share) → it reads the
link → you pick kind + quality (or rename it) → Download. Files land in a
folder you choose in Settings. The 💬 icon in the top bar and the Settings
footer open a feedback email to **feedit18@gmail.com**.

## 1b. The core (server + web UI)

You need **Python 3**, **yt-dlp**, and (for merging/converting) **ffmpeg**.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U yt-dlp      # Windows:  py -m pip install -U yt-dlp
# ffmpeg:
#   Windows: winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
#   macOS:   brew install ffmpeg deno
#   Linux:   sudo apt install ffmpeg
#   Android: see section 4
```

Then start the app:

```bash
python3 -m grabbox            # or double-click the launcher below
```

A window opens at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

| Platform | Launcher |
|---|---|
| Windows | double-click `scripts\grabbox.bat` |
| Linux | `./scripts/grabbox.sh` |
| macOS | double-click `scripts/grabbox.command` |
| Anywhere | `python3 -m grabbox` from the repo root |

Useful flags: `--dir FOLDER`, `--port 8765`, `--host 0.0.0.0` (reach it from
other devices on your LAN), `--watch-clipboard` (auto-pick-up copied links).

Paste any link → it tells you what it is (video / audio / image / software /
archive) and the size → pick a quality → Download. The Queue shows live
progress; Downloads lists, opens, reveals and deletes files.

> If a download 403s, GrabBox already walks the retry ladder and tells you the
> next step. See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## 2. Browser extension (Chrome / Edge / Brave / Firefox)

1. Open `chrome://extensions` (or `brave://extensions`, `edge://extensions`).
   Firefox: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` → Load Temporary Add-on.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. **Load unpacked** → select the `extension/` folder.

Now:
* The toolbar icon is **faded** on pages with nothing to grab, and lights up +
  shows a count where there is.
* **Right-click** any link / video / audio / image → "Grab with GrabBox".
* **Hover** a video, image or file link → a small faded ↓ button appears; click
  it to grab.
* Either way an **in-page dialog** pops up right there on the page: pick kind
  and quality, rename if you like, hit Download — you never leave the tab.
* The popup lists every detected downloadable thing on the page.

The extension needs the app running on the same machine — either the desktop
app (section 1a) or the core server (`python3 -m grabbox`, section 1b). It
talks to `http://127.0.0.1:8765`, nothing touches the internet but the
download itself.

## 3. How the installers get built

Three workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

* **release** — the one that matters to users. **Actions → release → Run
  workflow** → type a version (`0.2.1`), or push a tag `v0.2.1`. It stamps the
  version into the desktop and Android apps (`tools/stamp_version.py`), builds
  every installer, and publishes a GitHub Release with the stable file names
  from section 1a plus `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
* **desktop (Tauri)** — compiles the desktop app on every push as a smoke test
  (artifacts under Actions, login required, 90-day expiry).
* **build** — same idea for the Android APKs and a single-folder PyInstaller
  build per OS (`GrabBox-windows-latest`, `GrabBox-ubuntu-latest`,
  `GrabBox-macos-latest`), handy for USB sticks. To build that one locally
  (from the repo root):

```bash
pip install pyinstaller yt-dlp
pyinstaller packaging/grabbox.spec --noconfirm     # -> dist/GrabBox/
```

### Changing the logo

Every icon — Android launcher, notification shade, desktop app, browser
extension, web favicon, the logo inside the web app's own header — is generated
from one description of the mark in `tools/brand.py`: an isometric box with a
download arrow cut into the front corner, plus three speed sparks off the
top-right edge. Edit the geometry or palette there, then:

```bash
python3 tools/make_android_icons.py   # mipmaps, adaptive + vector layers
python3 tools/make_app_icon.py        # desktop PNGs, icon.ico, icon.icns
python3 tools/make_icons.py           # extension toolbar icons, both states
python3 tools/make_web_icons.py       # web favicon + the logo in the app header
```

Pure Python, no Pillow — the same constraint the rest of `tools/` works under.
Run all three or the surfaces drift apart. The generated files carry a
"do not edit by hand" header; change `brand.py` instead.

One detail worth knowing: `drawable/ic_stat_grabbox.xml` is the notification
icon, and it is deliberately separate from the launcher icon. The status bar
draws `setSmallIcon` as a flat silhouette, so pointing `DownloadService` at
`ic_launcher_fg` is what produces the white blob in the shade.

## 4. Android

**The native app (recommended)** — a real Kotlin app with the yt-dlp engine
bundled inside, so there is no server, no Termux, no terminal anywhere.
Android 7.0 or newer (the bundled engine needs API 24).

1. Grab the APK for your phone from the
   [Releases page](https://github.com/sharthak18/A-WAY-TO-DOWNLOAD-YOUTUBE-AUDIO-/releases/latest):
   `GrabBox-Android.apk` (almost every phone from the last ~8 years),
   `GrabBox-Android-32bit.apk` (very old 32-bit phones), or
   `GrabBox-Android-x86_64.apk` (emulators).
2. Install it. Android will warn about "unknown apps from this source" the
   first time — allow it for your browser/file manager. That's the only hoop;
   sideloading is normal for apps distributed outside the Play Store.
3. Open **GrabBox**. That's it — the engine unpacks itself on first launch.

Using it:

- **Share any link → GrabBox** — from YouTube, a browser, a chat — the app
  opens with the video already probed. Pick quality, tap Download.
- **Or paste a link** inside the app and tap **Grab**.
- Music saves as real audio files (m4a default, mp3/vorbis/opus available);
  videos merge to mp4 via the bundled ffmpeg.

Permissions, handled the first time they matter:

- **Notifications** (Android 13+) — so you can see download progress and tap
  the finished file. Grant once, never asked again.
- **All-files access** (Android 11+) — requested so files land in the familiar
  `Download/GrabBox` folder. If you'd rather skip it, Settings lets you switch
  to the app's own folder instead (no permission needed, still accessible via
  Files → GrabBox).
- Nothing else. No account, no data leaves the phone except the downloads.

Tips:

- **Settings → Update yt-dlp engine** refreshes the engine over the network.
  YouTube changes break downloaders every few months; this fixes it without
  waiting for a new APK.
- **Settings → Download folder** picks where files go.

<details>
<summary><b>Nerd path (Termux)</b></summary>

Prefer running the same server-based UI in Termux instead (e.g. so a tablet or
desktop on your Wi-Fi can reach it too)?

```bash
bash android/termux-install.sh     # from the repo root
```

It installs python + ffmpeg + yt-dlp + deno, starts the server, and opens the
UI. Downloads go to `Download/GrabBox` on your internal storage.

## 5. Reach it from other devices

```bash
python3 -m grabbox --host 0.0.0.0
```

Then any phone/tablet on your Wi-Fi opens `http://<your-laptop-ip>:8765`.
Great for sending a desktop download to a big drive while browsing on a phone.
