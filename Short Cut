Here is your complete "Legend's Cheat Sheet" for yt-dlp.

I have organized these into Music (Audio) and Video, plus the command to keep the tool updated.

🎵 1. The Music Commands (Audio Only)
Option A: The "Perfect" Single Song Downloads the highest quality audio (M4A), removes the weird ID from the name, adds the cover art, and fills in the artist info.

DOS
yt-dlp -x --audio-format m4a --add-metadata --embed-thumbnail -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" "PASTE_LINK_HERE"
Option B: The "Whole Album/Playlist" Downloads every song in a playlist, numbers them (01, 02...) so they play in order, and adds cover art.

DOS
yt-dlp -x --audio-format m4a --add-metadata --embed-thumbnail -o "%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s" "PASTE_PLAYLIST_LINK_HERE"
🎬 2. The Video Commands (High Quality Video)
By default, yt-dlp might give you an .mkv or .webm file, which some phones can't play. Use these commands to force a high-quality MP4 that works everywhere.

Option A: Best Quality Video (MP4) Downloads the best video and best audio, then merges them into a clean MP4 file.

DOS
yt-dlp -f "bv+ba/b" --merge-output-format mp4 -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" "PASTE_LINK_HERE"
Option B: Video with Subtitles Same as above, but also burns the subtitles (lyrics/dialogue) into the video if they exist.

DOS
yt-dlp -f "bv+ba/b" --merge-output-format mp4 --embed-subs -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" "PASTE_LINK_HERE"
🛠️ 3. Maintenance
Update Tool Run this once a month or if you get an error.

DOS
yt-dlp -U
⚡ PRO TIP: The "One-Click" Shortcut (No Typing)
Instead of typing these long codes every time, you can create a mini-program (a Batch file) on your desktop.

Open Notepad.

Paste the code below into it.

Save the file as Download_Music.bat (make sure you select "All Files" not "Text Documents").

Put this file in your youtube-dl folder.

Code for the Batch File:

Code snippet
@echo off
set /p url="Paste YouTube Link: "
echo Downloading High Quality Audio...
yt-dlp -x --audio-format m4a --add-metadata --embed-thumbnail -o "%%(title)s.%%(ext)s" "%url%"
echo Done! check your folder.
pause
How to use it: Now, you just double-click Download_Music.bat, paste your link, and hit Enter. It does everything for you.


Here is the code for your Download_Video.bat file.

How to create it:
Open Notepad.

Paste the code below.

Save it as Download_Video.bat (Make sure to save it in your youtube-dl folder).

Code snippet
@echo off
:: Ask for the link
set /p url="Paste YouTube Video Link: "

:: Download Best Video+Audio and merge into MP4
echo Downloading Best Quality Video (MP4)...
yt-dlp -f "bv+ba/b" --merge-output-format mp4 --add-metadata --embed-thumbnail -o "%%(title)s.%%(ext)s" "%url%"

echo.
echo ---------------------------------------------------
echo Done! The video is ready.
echo ---------------------------------------------------
pause
Note: I added --embed-thumbnail to this one too, so your video files on your computer will show the actual video thumbnail instead of a random frame!

Enjoy your collection!
